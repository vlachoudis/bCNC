# This script is meant to test serial loopback
# You need serial port with RX and TX shorted together
# Also you can use included arduino sketch that echoes back everything it receives
# This script sends random data and then checks if it gets received back
# If received data are different from the sent data, it reports error
# Leave this running for extended period of time to detect problems
# with wiring, EMI, chipset, etc...
