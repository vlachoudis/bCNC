# bCNC changelog

There are too much commits, so i've created this brief overview of new features in bCNC.

## Next
- Breaking changes:
  - Python3.8 is the lowest supported version. Starting bCNC with any prior version will fail. [#1719](https://github.com/vlachoudis/bCNC/issues/1719)

## 0.9.15

- New features
  - Python 3 is (mostly) supported now #228
  - 6 axis support #1384
  - Can load SVG files (~only paths without transformations~ improved by tatarize, see
    wiki) #902 #1312
  - Can slice 3D meshes in STL and PLY formats (with minor limitations) #901
  - Can export 3D scan (autolevel probe) data in XYZ format suitable for meshlab poisson
    surface reconstruction
  - Support for helical and ramp cutting #590
  - New style of tabs implemented using "islands" with support for arbitrary shapes and
    pockets #220
  - Interactive value entry is now possible in g-code scripting #1256

  - Start cycle can now be triggered by hardware button connected to arduino #885
- Improvements
  - Restructured UI #1057 and more
  - Better autodetection of serial ports (with device names, ids and without restarting
    bCNC)
  - Disabled blocks are commented-out in exported g-code #767
